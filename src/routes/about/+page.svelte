			Embark on a journey through the rich culinary traditions of Laos and Thailand, right here in
			the heart of Dickson, Canberra. Welcome to Two Sisters Lao Thai Cuisine, a family-run
			restaurant that has been a cherished part of the local dining scene for over 25 years.
			<br />
			<br />
			Our story begins with two sisters, whose shared passion for the authentic flavours of their homeland
			inspired them to open a restaurant. Their dream was to create a place where the community could
			gather to enjoy the traditional dishes of southern Laos and Thailand, just as they had done with
			their own family back home.
			<br />
			<br />
			Over the years, Two Sisters has grown from a small eatery into a beloved dining destination, but
			our commitment to family and tradition has never wavered. We're proud to say that we're still family-run,
			with the same dedication to authenticity and quality that inspired our founders.
			<br />
			<br />
			Our menu is a testament to our heritage, featuring traditional dishes crafted with love and respect
			for the culinary traditions of Laos and Thailand. From our tantalising noodles and stir-fries to
			our aromatic curries, every dish is a celebration of authentic flavours, made possible by our use
			of the freshest ingredients and time-honoured recipes.
			<br />
			<br />
			At Two Sisters, we invite you to be part of our family. Join us for a meal, and experience the
			warmth, hospitality, and delicious cuisine that has made us a staple in the Dickson community for
			over a quarter of a century. We can't wait to welcome you to our table.
